## What I do
I design experiments and build production-ready data pipelines and predictive models to measure incremental impact and optimize engagement. My work focuses on experimentation (A/B testing and uplift), causal inference, and building reproducible analytics infrastructure, enabling product and marketing teams to make high-confidence decisions.

---

## Portfolio Overview 
My portfolio demonstrates how I apply experimentation, causal inference, and predictive modeling to real-world decisions, including patient engagement optimization and operational forecasting. All projects are reproducible in Python with clean documentation

**Technical Stack:**
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib) • SQL • AWS • GCP • Docker • Terraform • Tableau • Power BI • Causal Inference

## Highlighted Projects
- **Healthcare Engagement Experimentation Dashboard:** Designed controlled A/B tests measuring communication timing effects, resulting in ~6% uplift in engagement.
- **ETL Pipeline Automation:** Modularized data cleaning workflows; reduced setup time for new analysts by 50%.
- **Performance Forecasting Model:** Built regression models to predict engagement trends; improved forecast accuracy by 18%.
