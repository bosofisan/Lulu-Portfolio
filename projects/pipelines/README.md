# Clinical Data Pipeline Automation

**Role:** Data Engineer / Applied Data Scientist  
**Tools:** SQL, Python, Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS S3

## Problem
Analytics tables lagged behind source systems and were inconsistent, slowing experiments and decision-making.

## Approach
- Built modular ETL scripts and Docker containers for reproducibility.  
- Added schema validation and automated tests.  
- Implemented CI (GitHub Actions) and monitoring (Grafana CloudWatch).

## Results
- Reduced analyst onboarding/setup time by **50%**.  
- Cut experimental time-to-insight from days to hours.  
- Improved data quality and model stability.

## Artifacts
- `projects/pipelines/Dockerfile`  
- `projects/pipelines/etl.py`
