## What I do
I design experiments and build production-ready data pipelines and predictive models to measure incremental impact and optimize engagement. My work focuses on experimentation (A/B testing, uplift), causal inference, and building reproducible analytics infrastructure so product and marketing teams can make high-confidence decisions.
